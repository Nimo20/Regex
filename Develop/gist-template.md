# Regex Tutorial: Understanding Hex Color Codes

## Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will delve into the regular expression /^([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ to understand how it defines the search pattern for hex color codes.

## Summary:

The regex /^([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ matches 6-character or 3-character hex color codes. It ensures that the string starts with a '#' followed by either 6 or 3 characters from the set [a-f0-9], representing valid hex color values.

## Start Anchor (^)

- The caret ^ symbol indicates the start of the string.
- It ensures that the regex match must begin at the very beginning of the string. In other words, the hex color code must start right after the ^.

#### Code Snippet:

```md
^
```
#### Example:

Matching: #FFFFFF (Valid hex color code)

Not Matching: ABC123 (Doesn't start with '#')

## Hex Color Code Group ([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})

- This part of the regex pattern defines the core of the search pattern for hex color codes.
- '[a-f0-9]' represents the valid characters for a hex color code. It includes the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F (case insensitive).
- '{6}' specifies that there must be exactly six characters from the set [a-f0-9]. This matches a standard 6-character hex color code.
- '|' serves as an alternation operator, allowing the regex to match either a 6-character hex color code or a 3-character hex color code.
- '[a-f0-9]{3}' indicates that there must be exactly three characters from the set [a-f0-9]. This matches a shorter 3-character hex color code.

#### Code Snippet:

```md
([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})
```
#### Example:

Matching: #0aBcDe (Valid 6-character hex color code)

Matching: #123 (Valid 3-character hex color code)

Not Matching: #12G (Contains invalid character 'G')

## End Anchor ($)

- The dollar $ symbol indicates the end of the string.
- It ensures that the regex match must end at the very end of the string. In other words, there should be no characters after the matched hex color code.

#### Code Snippet:

```md
$
```

#### Example:

Matching: #ABC123 (Valid hex color code)

Not Matching: #ABC123  (Extra space at the end)
